  I have the same issue as 'Warwick'  (he posted December 2020). I can get it
  all setup any have my Dymo 4XL be network connected. The default setting on
  the pi (3B+ running Ubuntu) is the 4x6 shipping albels. When I connect to the
  networked printer on Windows, the only available paper option is business card
  2x 3 5, using the IPP class driver. Nothing else. I can print, but it uses
  that paper format.  Change the print driver from IPP to the 4XL makes the
  paper options become available, but of course that won't work for printing.
  Anyone have an idea on how to resolve?
