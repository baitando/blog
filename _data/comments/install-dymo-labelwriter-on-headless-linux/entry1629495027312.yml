  There are recent comments here so I'll point out that, at least under Ubuntu
  14.04 through 20.04, the separate step to fetch and extract the PPD files is
  not necessary. They're installed in compressed form by the apt install of
  printer-driver-dymo. Do a "lpinfo -m | grep dymo" and you'll get a list of
  Dymo drivers available. They'll have names like
  "dymo:0/cups/model/lw450tt.ppd". Specify all of that with the -m option when
  adding the printer and the PPD will be extracted and installed without needing
  to fetch files directly from Dymo. I wasn't able to find them on Dymo's site,
  so was happy to find them in the printer-driver-dymo package from Ubuntu. The
  rest of the install worked well for me and I was able to print nicely
  formatted, rotated, and sized labels from a test.txt file with: "lp -d lw450
  -o media=w79h252 -o orientation-requested=4 -o cpi=13 -o page-left=12 -o
  page-top=12 test.txt". "lw450" is obviously the name of my printer. This
  worked for me under Ubuntu 14.04.5 and 20.04. I assume it works for all
  versions in between.
